## Lucid Programming Language

The Lucid Programming language by Wadge and Ashcroft. 

This is pLucid the first interpreter for Lucid. I do not own any rights to this codebase. I am uploading this on github for better navigability and for anyone hoping to study the algebra of histories as described by Strachey.
